# Basic-Multiplayer-Socket-System

While the server is running 2 clients can connect and interact with eachother through a very basic combat system. This project was only 
done so I could learn more about sockets, was not meant to be a full game. Before running the server and client, be sure to adjust
the "host" variable accordingly.
